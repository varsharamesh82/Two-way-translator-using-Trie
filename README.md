# Two-way-translator-using-Trie

## About the project:

Our projects goal is to develop a set of tools for translating texts between multiple languages in real time with high quality.
Languages are in separate modules in the tool and can be varied using different prototypes
The principle of translating is simple: a system decides an appropriate translation of an input word by analysing the pre- translated word in the database. Therefore the input English sentence is first checked with database and if it exists , it is then translated into bilingual corpora for an exact match. Hence the corresponding French word is retrieved and displayed as output.
A history tab has been developed in our project to ensure that our user can access his previously accessed words so that he doesnâ€™t have to waste time in researching for the same words. It thus saves time and memory
The random word of the day increases our users knowledge and keeps his engaged to our project. It is a fun and an interactive part of the code.
